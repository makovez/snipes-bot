# Snipes
An attemp to bypass px and an unofficial api for snipes. To scrape products, login, add to cart and buy any products.
bypass px files are located in Snipes/js and Snipes/pxCaptcha

probably either snipes or recaptcha updated api after almost 1year now...
but you can use this a starting point and look how i bypassed px captcha.

This project aimed to do many other activities such as:
- restock mode to automatically buy new restocked products given some key names
- monitor mode to monitor and buy products on drops
- it also stores persistent sessions
- buy products, login and all things a normal account does
- register new accounts automatically
- bypass ParamiterX (files are located in Snipes/js and Snipes/pxCaptcha)

It is all verry messy now, as those things were still in a testing phase, then I abandoned the project due to lack of time.
